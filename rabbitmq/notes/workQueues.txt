#Introduction
    -Create multiple consumers to handle the tasks
    -Multiple consumers listening to a queues

#How-to
    -Dispatching
        -Round Robin Dispatching
            -Usual way
            -nth request is given to the nth consumer
                -if the requests alternate between a heavy and light and the load shared by 2 consumers, one consumer
                    will always be assigned the heavy and the other light
        -Fair Dispatch
            -Forces rabbitmq to not dispatch a message to consumer if it is busy, chose the next consumer
                -$channel->basic_qos(null, 1, null);
    -Acknowledge
         -If a consumer dies midway of a task, no way for rabbitmq to assign to other consumers to redo
         -Forces the consumers to send acknowledgement when they are done
            -$msg->delivery_info['channel']->basic_ack($msg->delivery_info['delivery_tag']);
            -turn on message ack
                -$channel->basic_consume('hello', '', false, false, false, false, $callback);
                    -4th arg stands for no-ack, make it false
