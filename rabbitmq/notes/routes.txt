#Introduction
    -With routes, we can specify which messages goes to which consumers
    -Means, we can add a tag to a message we put in the queue
        -A consumer can accept message with the tag he is interested in

#How-to
    -Work with the binding
        -Use a binding key to bind a consumer to a message
            -$channel->queue_bind($queue_name, $exchange_name, $binding_key);
            -In this case, the consumer is only interested in the messages with the specific '$binding_key'
    -Another type of exchange
        -Enter the direct exchange
            $channel->exchange_declare('direct_logs', 'direct', false, false, false);
            $channel->basic_publish($msg, 'direct_logs', $severity);
        -The third param is the binding_key of the message passed to the queue
