service container:
     special PHP object in Symfony that helps you instantiate, organize and retrieve the many objects of your application.
     Service container, will allow you to standardize and centralize the way objects are constructed in your application.

     Services can be configured in services.yml in app.config,
     Ex :
         services:
               odd_even_checker:
                   class: NewBundle\Services\OddEvenChecker
               meta_info_printer:
                   class: NewBundle\Services\MetaInfoPrinter
                   arguments: ['@odd_even_checker']

     This can then be retrieved from a controller.
     Ex:         $metaInfoPrinter = $this->get('meta_info_printer');

        This is another major advantage of using the service container.
        Namely, a service is never constructed until it's needed.
        If you define a service and never use it on a request, the service is never created.
        This saves memory and increases the speed of your application.
        This also means that there's very little or no performance hit for defining lots of services.
        Services that are never used are never constructed.
        Plus, once a service is created, it is reused for other requests.

    Also, consider using inheritance tree when using common dependencies,

service tags:
    - Services can be tagged for a specific purpose
    - Tags are a way to tell Symfony or other third-party bundles that your service
        should be registered or used in some special way by the bundle
    - Dependency Injection Tags
        - ex: if you have a service that you would like to register
            as a listener to one of Symfony's core events,
            you can flag it with the kernel.event_listener tag
        - read more here: http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/dic_tags.html
    - Custom tags
        - You can create custom tags which can be used to tag a subset of services
        - Possible to fetch the entire subset of services which are tagged with a specific tag
            - consider the case where we like to have a list of 'mail transporters' used to send mails
            - the transporters are used by a mail sender to send mails
                - create the mail sender with a setter or addTransporter method
                - create the different transporter services in the container
                - tag the transporter services with a specific user defined tag
                - write a compiler pass to fetch all the services with the particular tag
                - fetch the transporters in the compiler pass and inject them to the mail sender service

bundle : grouping code for a specific purpose into a plugin like reusable package
Three environment scopes : dev, prod and test

the first thing to get loaded is the routing.yml from the app/config folder
-- in the routing.yml in the app/config folder, the routing for each bundle can be specified
    -- can be annotation or a routing.yml in the resource folder of a bundle

twig
 - extend the base.html.twig

Questions

- The resources within a bundle in src vs the resources in app
