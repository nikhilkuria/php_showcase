HttpKernelInterface
    - has a method handle
        - responsible for converting request to response

Flow of the web/app.php

##Create an AppKernel first

AppKernel
    - Class specific to the project
    - Load Bundles
    - 2 constructor params
        - name of the environment
            - the name passed is used to load the environment specific configuration

                  public function registerContainerConfiguration(LoaderInterface $loader)
                  {
                      $loader->load($this->getRootDir().'/config/config_'.$this->getEnvironment().'.yml');
                  }

        - debug mode or not


##Create a Request object

Using the superglobals in PHP
    - read more http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php

##Call the handle method of AppKernel
    - the only param is the Request object
    - the handle() method is implemented in the kernel class, which is the parent of the AppKernel
    - ensure the kernel is booted. Booting includes
        - initiliaze the registered Bundles
            - bundles are returned as an array from the method registerBundles in AppKernel
        - initialize the service containers

##Get result of the handle operation
    - the result of the handle operation is the Response object
